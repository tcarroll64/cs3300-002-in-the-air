# Model-View-Template (MVT) Architecture

The Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture is commonly used in web development frameworks such as Django. MVT separates an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Template. This architectural pattern helps organize and manage the structure of web applications efficiently.

## Components

1. **Model**
   - The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the application's data structure and handles interactions with the database.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Define data structures and database schemas.
     - Handle data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.
     - Implement business logic and application rules.
     - Notify the View and Template about changes in data.

2. **View**
   - The View component is responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting data to the user. It doesn't contain business logic but rather displays data received from the Model.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Receive data from the Model.
     - Render the user interface and display information to users.
     - Handle user input and pass it to the Template or the Controller.

3. **Template**
   - The Template defines the structure and layout of the final HTML that is sent to the user's browser. It is responsible for generating dynamic HTML content based on data from the Model and user interactions.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Define HTML templates with placeholders for dynamic data.
     - Combine templates with data from the Model to produce the final HTML.
     - Handle presentation and layout of the user interface.

## Workflow

MVT follows a specific workflow that allows for it to handle a Client-Server communication.

1. **User Interaction**
   - A user interacts with the web application by making requests (e.g., clicking buttons, submitting forms).

2. **URL**
   - An application's URL tells the server which View or Template should handle the user's request.

3. **View Processing**
   - View is responsible for handling the request, which may include communicating with the Model to fetch data or perform other operations.
   - The View then passes the data to the Template.

4. **Template Rendering**
   - The Template combines the received data with specific HTML structure to generate dynamic HTML content.

5. **HTTP Response**
   - View then sends the dynamic HTML content back to the Client in the form of an HTTP response, where it is rendered and displayed on their
